            <h2>why is good to donate to unicef?</h2>
            <p> It is good for building a better and fairer society depends on the guarantee of the rights of children and adolescents.</p> </br>
            <p>Because UNICEF is the leading global reference point for knowledge about issues affecting children and adolescents and development work for their benefit.
            This credibility has evolved as a result of a lot of work and commitment, through the development and exchange of social technologies in the 191 countries where we are present.</p></br>
           <p> Because UNICEF contributes directly to improving the living conditions of children at high risk through technical expertise and financial support.
            These are actions that enable the development of good practices and methodologies to promote wide-ranging structural changes. These experiences are systematized and disseminated on a large scale by UNICEF when implemented through public policies.</p></br>
           <h4> So they can reach more people and make those good practices to other places that rely on the voluntary contributions of individuals.</h4>
